# Appointment Scheduling Tool
- I built this project as a way to learn how to use FastAPI, which is a fast and high performing web framework for building APIs. FastAPI also has interactive API documentation provided by Swagger UI, which is convenient for viewing and interacting with each endpoint.
- This tool is meant to be used as a backend API to integrate a doctor's appointment calendar. Users can see a list of all doctors in the network, see the doctor's appointment calendar, make/delete and update appointments.
## ðŸ¤– Technologies

GET: Fetch the schedule for a doctor by doctor_id for a certain date. Dates must be in isoformat.

POST: Make a new appointment <br>
Constraints - Appointments must be in 15 minute intervals and no more than 3 appointments are allowed for a time slot

DELETE: Delete an appointment by appointment_id

PATCH: Update an appointment by appointment_id. Any number of fields can be updated, but will return a 400 or 404 if appointment_id does not exist or appointment datetime is invalid or if time slots are full.

## Feature Updates
- Implement a database to make querying for appointments more robust. It will also allow us to build a relational model for doctors, users and appointments.
